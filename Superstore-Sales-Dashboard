This is my first dashboard where I not only did analysis but also forecasted the sales for next 15 days. Here are the few steps I did:
1. Downloaded a dataset from kaggle.
2. Did some necessary cleaning and imported the data in Power BI.
3. Then, started analysing the data I just cleaned.
4. You can find the dashboard [here](https://app.powerbi.com/links/jf51b0qOBU?ctid=b6d87d95-f34b-42ef-925d-9c7e8ec612ba&pbi_source=linkShare)
6. Finally, I concluded that:
The total sales is 1.6 Million and the profit 175 Thousand for 2019 and 2020.
Consumer segment added more to the sales in both these years. Whereas, the category office supplies had more sales but the category technology gave more profit.
Sales have increased over the years and December remained prominent in both years.
People chose Standard Class more to get their orders shipped.
And as we know Cash on Delivery has always been a risky payment mode. We also saw how there were more orders returned on COD as payment mode.
